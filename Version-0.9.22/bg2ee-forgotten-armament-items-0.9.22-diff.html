According to these accounts, the githyanki wizard-smith Ir'mlar forged the blade many centuries ago in dark caverns deep beneath Tu'narath. This githyanki city floats in the Astral Plane upon the petrified corpse of a dead god known only as "the One in the Void." To craft the sword, Ir'mlar allegedly used the One's own bones, which consist of a metallic substance unknown on the Prime Material Plane. The smith then imbued the weapon with a fiendish entity whom some seers claim was a mighty prince of the lower plane of Carceri. Others claim the sword contains the One in the Void's own spirit, banished within the blade for crimes committed against other gods in past ages. In any case, Ir'revrykal possesses such an enmity against good that only blackguards committed to evil may wield it. Circular runes etched on the blade proclaim its name in ancient tir'su, the githyanki language. The runes translate roughly as "Pain-Servant."

After Ysridain's death at the hands of a jilter lover, the people of Waterdeep learned just how true those rumors had been. Early in his career, Ysridain realized that his physical beauty was far greater than his talent with music. He was a gifted musician, but he knew he would never be legendary unless he had assistance. Ysridain contracted a wizard to summon forth a powerful demon so the bard could negotiate a pact with the forces of darkness. A succubus answered the call. She agreed to inspire Ysridain with creative forces beyond his understanding. In exchange, upon his death, all that had resulted from her inspiration and Ysridain's soul would be hers.

Ysridain thought on this for a short time and eventually agreed to the succubus' deal. The succubus occupied a pendant that Ysridain wore around his neck. It had the effect of inspiring the bard to great musical deeds, but it also created intense physical lust. When Ysridain died, the bard's soul was swapped into the amulet and the succubus was released into the world. If the amulet ever shatters, Ysridain's soul will be dragged straight to the lower planes. Until then, Ysridain's succubus roams Faerun searching for the children sired by the bard's lust.

Early in his career, Ysridain realized that his physical beauty was far greater than his talent with music. He was a gifted musician, but he knew he would never be legendary unless he had assistance. Ysridain contracted a wizard to summon forth a powerful demon so the bard could negotiate a pact with the forces of darkness. A succubus answered the call. She agreed to inspire Ysridain with creative forces beyond his understanding. In exchange, upon his death, all that had resulted from her inspiration and Ysridain's soul would be hers.

Ysridain thought on this for a short time and eventually agreed to the succubus' deal. The succubus occupied a pendant that Ysridain wore around his neck. It had the effect of inspiring the bard to great musical deeds, but it also created intense physical lust. When Ysridain died, the bard's soul was swapped into the amulet and the succubus was released into the world. If the amulet ever shatters, Ysridain's soul will be dragged straight to the lower planes. Until then, Ysridain's succubus roams Faerun searching for the children sired by the bard's lust.

She left the tribe, relinquished her position to the old head warrior, and returned his belt to him. But before she left, she swore to never harm a member of the tribe if she encountered one in the future.

Years later, she looked back on that fateful day and felt pride in the fact that she had beaten the greatest men of her tribe. She had a belt constructed that looked identical to the belt she had won. Not content to stop there, she had a priest of Tempus bless it with a powerful enchantment.

<tr><th class="title">MOFP02<br/>Armor of Gram the Mouse</th><td class="description before"><pre>At the age of eighteen, a small young man from Voonlar named Gram Chandler was inducted into the ranks of the Damaran paladins of Torm. Nicknamed "the Mouse" by his fellow classmates for his small size and great love of cheese, Gram had become well-respected during his time as an initiate. However, when it came time to arm and armor the initiates as full paladins of the church, the embarrassed order found that it did not possess a suit small enough to fit Gram. The priests and paladins apologized to Gram and told him they would get a suit of armor made as quickly as possible. Though Gram's classmates snickered about it, Gram smiled and quietly went about his business.

Only a month later, while most of the other paladins of the church were away on business, a lone wounded rider approached the Tormish fortress and demanded to see whoever was in charge. Gram was far from in charge, but there were no paladins of rank present. The rider turned out to be a Thayan escort for a female Red Wizard who had been attacked by bugbears in the wilderness. The priests sneered at the rider when they learned of his nationality, but Gram told the escort it was his duty to protect travelers from aggression within Tormish territory. The priests tried to dissuade Gram from attempting to go after the Red Wizard, but Gram rebuked them and repeated to the escort that it would be his honor to mount a rescue effort.

Protected only by his helmet and the heavy hide demanded by the climate, Gram followed the escort to the site of the battle. From there, the escort tracked the bugbears to a cave. When Gram and the escort entered, they immediately came under heavy attack from bugbears. The escort's resolve faded and he fled back into the wilderness. Gram pressed on, killing four bugbears and wounding two more before he died within sight of the Red Wizard. Though the bugbears were by no means wiped out, the attack weakened and confused them enough that the Red Wizard was able to blast her way out of the cave system.

Later, she returned to Damara and approached the priests of the wilderness temple of Torm from which Gram came. When she learned about the selfless valiance of Gram, even her Thay-hardened heart was moved. She had a suit of armor constructed and enchanted for her small savior. It was built to the finest standards of quality, and it is said that the priests and paladins of Torm assembled at Gram's burial gasped in awe at its beauty. In later years, Gram was used as an example of devotion to duty for fledgling paladins. His revered tomb was looted by a fractured orcish army from Vaasa when the temple was destroyed in 1298 DR.

<tr><th class="title">MOGLV02<br/>Favor of Ilum Lura</th><td class="description before"><pre>The city of Nivian in ancient Illefarn observed an annual custom in which the six districts of the city vied for possession of the statue of a local hero. The tradition dictated that each of the districts participate in a non-lethal grand melee. The last combatant standing claimed the prize for his or her district. Since civic chaos was not the desired effect, each district had a champion that fought for its citizens. Though not required, champions often enjoyed a large morale boost when they had the patronage of a noble family.

In -1239 DR, the champion of the Artisan's District was a man named Beloran. Beloran was a man seemingly possessed by his desire to win the championship for his district. He had tried to do so for six years and failed each time. Unbeknownst to the citizens of the city, Beloran's sole motivation for participating in the melee was to earn the favor of the emperor's niece. The beautiful woman, Ilum Lura, had always politely rejected Beloran's advances. After six years of misplaced civic pride, Ilum's father commanded his daughter to give Beloran a token of her favor. She reluctantly did so, giving him a pair of riding gloves that he wore pinned to the shoulder of his sword arm. To the surprise of everyone outside the family, Beloran fought more ferociously than he ever had before. He won the statue for the Artisan's District. As custom dictated, this also meant that he was to receive a kiss from the lady whose favor he had worn into battle. Ilum gave Beloran his kiss and immediately retreated to her family estate.

In the following months, an inflamed and confused Beloran tried in vain to kindle a relationship with the elusive Ilum. She eventually agreed to meet with him, but only told him that her heart belonged to another. Deranged with grief at this revelation, Beloran journeyed into the deepest forests of Illefarn and was never heard from again. Those who saw him leave Nivian said that he was still wearing Ilum's favor upon his shoulder.

He was not trusted with serious tasks, certainly not ones that required martial prowess.

To ensure that pilgrims were able to see their caravan, the group carried a bright green banner bearing the symbol of Torm on each side. When the caravan came under attack from orcs, the paladin leader shouted a command to Gram not to let the flag fall under any circumstances. Gram grabbed the flag and, moments later, the paladin who commanded him was shot dead by orcs. The other initiates charged forward toward the orcs and told Gram to get down, to find some cover. Gram refused, standing tall as arrows sailed around him. Inevitably, one of the orcish arrows hit Gram in the side of the head. He continued to remain upright, though the slow loss of blood eventually caused his footing to give way. The initiates believed Gram was dead, and returned to the temple for reinforcements.

Pilgrims found the caravan an hour later, long after the orcs had retreated from their positions. Gram was mostly frozen, upright but unconscious, still clutching the tilted flagstaff in his hands.
