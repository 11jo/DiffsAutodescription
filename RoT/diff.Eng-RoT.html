Requires: 13 Strength</pre></td><td class="description after"><pre>Once a young man called Tapio Perkiomaki lived in a small village near Baldur's Gate. He had many friends in the village but one day he decided to leave the place and move to Baldur's Gate. He couldn't just leave without giving something to his friends so for a week he worked with this halberd. At the night when he had finished it, he left it to the center of the village and wrote "My Legacy" on the ground. Then he left and nobody ever saw him again. When his friends woke at morning they found the halberd and knew who had made it. Since then it has been the pride of that small village, until stolen.
