The thief was a cynical burglar named Ilfain Blackfeather.  Legedain was growing old and becoming tired of his frail body.  To remedy the situation, he cast Magic Jar and forced Ilfain's spirit into a host gem.  Legedain then transferred his soul to the young elf's body and left the gem on a shelf nearby.

To remedy the situation, he cast Magic Jar and forced Ilfain's spirit into a host gem.  Legedain then transferred his soul to the young elf's body and left the gem on a shelf nearby.

The power of the Mirror of Black Ice lies in its ability to confound the sight of an attacker.  Merely wearing it provides a boon to the wearer's defenses, as attackers will discover the wearer suddenly isn't where they thought he was when they first attacked.  By concentrating on the mirror, however, the wearer may alter what others see when they look at him, distorting his image to make him harder to hit, or splitting his image into several reflections of himself, further confusing attackers.

It still serves the same function as the original black ice mirror, but it feels much lighter now, and the reflections within the mirror seem both sharper and duller at the same time.

The power of the Mirror of Black Ice lies in its ability to confound the sight of an attacker.  Merely wearing it provides a boon to the wearer's defenses, as attackers will discover the wearer suddenly isn't where they thought he was when they first attacked.  By concentrating on the mirror, however, the wearer may alter what others see when they look at him, distorting his image to make him harder to hit, or splitting his image into several reflections of himself, further confusing attackers.  The mirror contains only a limited number amount of energy to perform these greater feats, but when the Blur and Mirror Image powers are gone, the passive defenses will remain.

The cloak twists in torchlight, each strand of hair raveling and unraveling about the others so subtly that it appears as if a light breeze is rippling the cloak.

This cloak is woven from the hair of virgins sent to the Burial Isle to sleep with their dead barbarian lords.  It was the Seer's duty to comfort these women, to soothe their pain - in order to do so, she took a lock of hair from each and wove the strands into a cloak that would draw the spirits of fear from the virgins and steady their hearts.  The result was a cloak that hangs heavy with guilt and does little to shield the wearer from the cold of the North.  

When worn, the hairs weave around the wielder's frame, the long strands lacing together like threads on a loom.  The cloak will not willingly unravel itself from a wearer without being coerced by a Remove Curse spell.

When the dwarves asked to be released, Hegelfden denied their request.  He wanted to keep them as servants.  The dwarves then laid a curse upon Hegelfden.  They told him that the fruit of his abuse would be the end of him.  Hegelfden laughed at the dwarves' claim and continued on with his life.  The next day, in a battle with a rival tribe, Hegelfden went berserk with blood lust, slaying every creature he came across.  His kin, convinced that he had gone mad, cut him down where he stood.

If the wearer uses a psionic power of aura alteration to change the aura, the wearer must save vs. spells or else change alignment to chaotic evil.  If the wearer saves, or if the wearer fails to save but is already chaotic-evil, the psionic power functions normally, and the ring's aura is temporarily changed.

This is how the Hellblades came to surface on the mortal world of man.  Nobody knows how many blades were actually forged and enchanted and how many still exist after so many centuries.  All that is known is that the Hellblades are weapons of quite evil power.

Overall Effects:  Each Hellblade functions as a modified Sword of Sharpness, they are all +3 weapons and can sever a random limb on a natural roll of 20.  These weapons are so powerful and evilly enchanted that if broken they will simply reform themselves and if ever torn away from their owner they will simple slide closer to get within the presense of their owner, distance not being a factor, though it may take some time to get to its owner if the distance is very great.  However, their most known power is the ability, on a natural 20, to instantly kill a target.  Those slain by a Hellblade are dead, and cannot be raised or resurrected.  Each Hellblade also has an ego, Intelligence, and a defensive power to help its owner.  Hellblades cannot, however, talk, use Telepathy, and the like.

It was rumored many a year ago that during the great wars when the Elves united to battle the Dark Elves and to cause them to flee to the vast underground, Gulgaraith, a well-experienced fighter/mage Dark Elf, forged numerous swords of great power to help in those wars.  This is how the Hellblades came to surface on the mortal world of man.  Nobody knows how many blades were actually forged and enchanted and how many still exist after so many centuries.  All that is known is that the Hellblades are weapons of quite evil power.

Overall Effects:  Each Hellblade functions as a modified Sword of Sharpness, they are all +3 weapons and can sever a random limb on a natural roll of 20.  These weapons are so powerful and evilly enchanted that if broken they will simply reform themselves and if ever torn away from their owner they will simple slide closer to get within the presense of their owner, distance not being a factor, though it may take some time to get to its owner if the distance is very great.  However, their most known power is the ability, on a natural 20, to instantly kill a target.  Those slain by a Hellblade are dead, and cannot be raised or resurrected.  Each Hellblade also has an ego, Intelligence, and a defensive power to help its owner.  Hellblades cannot, however, talk, use Telepathy, and the like.

<tr><th class="title">CBRJR004<br/>Sword of Nazger</th><td class="description before"><pre>This magical item is a long sword made of what appears to be dull, unpolished (and unpolishable) reddish tinted silver.  The blade is regular length for such a weapon, though slightly slimmer than what is normal for a long sword.  The hilt is a seperate piece and of regular steel.  The cross piece looks like two crescent moons each overlapping the other, similar to () overcrossing each other at the ends and the blade coming through the middle gap.  The hilt is also wrapped in a cross-hatched pattern of blue and green wire threads.

The blade was constructed some one-hundred-fifty years ago by a human ranger turned mage from the Archwood area, named Frasfer the Brown.  He and a few companions were keeping guard in the Archwood, when an influx of werewolves caused him to attempt the creation of a magical means to making their elimination easier.  One of his companions was a druid, and the mixing of druidic magic and wizard magic created a blade reknowned for a later owner.

That later owner was Nazger, a soldier of Sembia who found the sword fifty years ago.  He used it to find wererats that were murdering people in Highmoon, a city just northwest of the Archwood.  So Nazger exposed the wererats and killed most of them off.  However, while fighting in the sewers of the city he disappeared.  Nothing was ever again found of Nazger, except his sword.  It was later recognized in the market, but reported too late.  It was sold to a caravan heading to Ordulin.

As Nazgar had no immediate family the city guard did little investigation.  All that was turned up was that a street beggar found the blade in the sewers and thought to sell it for food in the market.  The begger claimed to know nothing else.

The powers of the blade may have become revealed to the caravan and thus kept, or may have remained unknown and sold as merely a silver sword.

The Sword of Nazger is an unintelligent magic blade that is normally +1 to hit/damage, but gives a +3 bonus to hit/damage versus werecreatures of all types.  It also gives the wielder a tingling sensation similar to when one's hand falls asleep when werecreatures are within 60' of the user, though it won't indicate who it is that is a werecreature, nor get more powerful if the werebeast gets closer.   The blade will also appear to have a set of glyphs along the blade if viewed under a full moon.

All that is normally visible of Zeladazar is a heavy steal hilt, from quillons to pommel. The pommel nut is a burnished steel sphere as large as a small orange.  The grip is wrapped in black leather, and the visible metal is blued, smooth-worn, and massive.

HISTORY:
     In the waning, decadent days of Netheril, a peculiar (for his people) sorcerer named Twyluth Ornadyn hit upon the idea that the salvation of the Netherese lay in turning their magical skills and lives back to living in harmorny with nature and other living things.  Ornadyn foresaw the need for battle magic to safeguard the survival of the Netherese as they learned the ways of all life, and he envisaged an armory of enchanted blades whose wielders could communicate with each other over long distances through meditation and the blades' transmission of mental images and audible speech.  He set about making a pair of these blades to test relevant existing magic and to develop new spells as necessary- but was slain by a treacherous apprentics, who snatched up one of the blades in the midst of it being imbued with an enchantment and beheaded Ornadyn.  The headless archmage's body lived on through previously cast defensive magics and took up the other sword to avenge himself.  In the ensuing battle, Ornadyn was hacked apart, but one of the blades exploded, destroying the apprentice utterly.
     The surviving sword was found and passed into the possession of the Netherese archwizard Alados Sorngol, who dubbed it the Sword of Dreams because of the visions handling it brought.  These images were sourced in the blade's enchantments and the revenant spirit of Ornadyn, who sent phantoms to frighten Alados ant to wrest control of the blade from him.  Their success was such that the terrified Alados bound new spells into the blade to make it a destroyer of undead- but died anyway when Ornadyn sent a last "blood spell" through the blade, searing the vitality of Alados with Ornadyn's own unlife, so that the essences of the two mages destroyed each other.

POWERS:
     Only magic can make the invisible blade of Zeladazar visible.  Whenever it is drawn, its wielder is immune to paralysis, energy drain, as well as enjoying the benefits of a Ring of Free Action.  Its wielder is able to move and attack freely and normally, even when attacked by a Web, Hold, or Slow spell (which Zeladazar gives its wielder complete immunity to) or when underwater (though the sword does not empower an air-breathing being to breathe under water).
     The Ghost Sword does 1d12 points of damage to all living creatures (regardless of size), and 4d12 points per successful strike to all undead creatures.  The touch of the blade destroys ghosts upon contact.

Ornadyn foresaw the need for battle magic to safeguard the survival of the Netherese as they learned the ways of all life, and he envisaged an armory of enchanted blades whose wielders could communicate with each other over long distances through meditation and the blades' transmission of mental images and audible speech.  He set about making a pair of these blades to test relevant existing magic and to develop new spells as necessary- but was slain by a treacherous apprentics, who snatched up one of the blades in the midst of it being imbued with an enchantment and beheaded Ornadyn.  The headless archmage's body lived on through previously cast defensive magics and took up the other sword to avenge himself.  In the ensuing battle, Ornadyn was hacked apart, but one of the blades exploded, destroying the apprentice utterly.
     The surviving sword was found and passed into the possession of the Netherese archwizard Alados Sorngol, who dubbed it the Sword of Dreams because of the visions handling it brought.  These images were sourced in the blade's enchantments and the revenant spirit of Ornadyn, who sent phantoms to frighten Alados ant to wrest control of the blade from him.  Their success was such that the terrified Alados bound new spells into the blade to make it a destroyer of undead- but died anyway when Ornadyn sent a last "blood spell" through the blade, searing the vitality of Alados with Ornadyn's own unlife, so that the essences of the two mages destroyed each other.

POWERS:
     Only magic can make the invisible blade of Zeladazar visible.  Whenever it is drawn, its wielder is immune to paralysis, energy drain, as well as enjoying the benefits of a Ring of Free Action.  Its wielder is able to move and attack freely and normally, even when attacked by a Web, Hold, or Slow spell (which Zeladazar gives its wielder complete immunity to) or when underwater (though the sword does not empower an air-breathing being to breathe under water).
     The Ghost Sword does 1d12 points of damage to all living creatures (regardless of size), and 4d12 points per successful strike to all undead creatures.  The touch of the blade destroys ghosts upon contact.

Dzance's Journals tell us of the properties of this item.  When he retired from adventuring to live in the Lady's Court at Silverymoon, Dzance gave the Guardian to Belpir, a young knight of that city.  The new owner forthwith went adventuring and has not been seen since.  The fates of Belpir and the Guardian are yet a mystery.

FUNCTION:

The Guardian is a "+0 Shield":  magical in nature but conferring no armor class bonus to its bearer besides the one-place benifit provided by any shield.  However, it has a special defensive power:  when worn, it radiates an insubstantial magical energy field that envelopes its bearer, and only the bearer, like an aura.  Any Magic Missile directed at the Guardian's bearer from any direction- not just ahead- strikes this field and is reflected unerringly back at the sender with no damage to the shieldbearer.  The field also absorbs all electrical discharges of natural or magical origin, such as shocking grasp, lightning bolt, or chain lightning, without harm to the bearer.  These attacks dissipate gradually and harmlessly if the shield is taken off, but if the shieldbearer can bring the shield into physical contact with a foe, the entire stored electrical energy of the field can be transmitted to the foe (save vs. paralyzation for half damage).  When this discharge is activated by the bearer's will, there is a 30% chance that the bearer and shield (but not any companion creatures or foes, will be Plane Shifted to a random known plane of existance.

All the fashion rage of early and modern Myth Drannor, these elaborate brooches are worn as amulets and neck jewelry, cameo breastpins, and cloak-fastening pins.  While each is distinct and unique in ists decoration, detail, and materials, all share a basic form: an oval-shaped ivory cameo, a large metal pin attached to the cameo's back, a recess within the pin's setting for a necklace chain, mementos, or secret items, and a basic enchantment.

When the giiraegisir is grasped and pulled down along its setting (sliding with a soft click in the setting but not pulling it out of its fastening), the base magic is activated: An invisible field of energy surrounds the wearer, providing Armor Class 0 for three rounds.  The giiraegis' magic is usable once per day, after which the pin is dormant and powerless for 24 hours.

Many giiraegisir are designed to bear special symbols, such as House seals or wizards' sigils, or include elaborate embellishments to make them major pieces of jewelry designed to display the opulence of the elf rather than boast of power.  They can appear as innate parts of an intricate stomacher on a noblewoman's gown, a belt buckle, over large earrings, or even an ornament on an armored bracer.

These giiraegisir are also adapted magically, and additional minor enchantments can be placed in them.  However, all the powers of a giiraegis are activated by whatever trigger is set within the cameo, whether it is shifted in its setting, rubbed sunwise twic, or simply tapped three times.

<tr><th class="title">CBSBMLTZ<br/>Lance +2</th><td class="description before"><pre>Une des premières armes de l'humanité, dont l'usage remonte aux époques les plus primitives. Les premières lances étaient de simples épieux, de longs bâtons avec une extrémité taillée en pointe. Avec la maîtrise du métal apparurent les pointes de lance en fer et en acier. Arrivés à ce stade, les expériences des fabricants d'armes avec différents types de fers de lance conduisirent au développement de certaines armes d'hast. D'autres tentatives d'amélioration se firent par l'intégration de magie dans les lances. Le chaman de la tribu enchantait les lances pour qu'elles touchent plus souvent et blessent plus gravement leurs adversaires.

<tr><th class="title">CBSTFSKL<br/>Staff of Skills</th><td class="description before"><pre>This staff, usable by all classes, can animate skeletal remains.  Each such operation, triggered by the word "Arise!", drains one charge.  Animated skeletons are under control of the wielder of the staff (cf. animate dead spell).  If the staff changes hands, control of the skeletons goes with it.  Skeletons need not be complete, but the skulls must be present, and skeletons lacking the parts of course have their actions and/or their mobility impaired.  Such animation is permanent, lasting until the magic is dispelled or the skeletons destroyed.

Twenty five percent of these staffs staves have a secondary function:  mending broken bones of both living and dead creatures.  This takes one charge, and in a round will reattach a severed limb or digit, or cure lost HP due to wounds.  Limbs or bones not belonging to the recipient may be used; thus a heap of bones can serve as "spare parts" for a guard of skeletons.  Typically, these staves are of ebony topped with an ivory skull, or constructed of a smooth polished skull and a thighbone of giant size.

  Can summon a skeletons per the Animate Dead spell, draining one charge
