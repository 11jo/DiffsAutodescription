<tr><th class="title">NW#CHN01<br/>Drow Assassin Mail</th><td class="description before"><pre>Drow chainmail is a finely crafted, satin-black metallic mesh that does not burden its wearer in any way. It is similar, but not identical, to magical elven chainmail. Typically, this armor is created for the torso only, as drow elves share their forest-bound cousins' preference for armor that protects accordingly without being overly heavy or restrictive. The exceptional lightness of this armor allows this item to be worn by thieves and warriors/wizards with few restrictions. In addition, the drow's chainmail provides a slight improvement in resistance to magic and slightly reduces the casting time of all spells while wearing it.

Unlike most dark elf items, this particular chain mail was not crafted with adamantine, as it was designed for spies and assassins who regularly travel to the surface. As such, it will not disintegrate into ashes when exposed to sunlight, but it does not offer as much protection as regular drow armor.

Every morning, at sunrise, one of the branches will flare faintly for a moment. Then it can be taken and planted in the ground, and another will immediately grow in its place. After the proper sorcery is recited, the planted branch transforms into a fearsome Shambler, whose strength and size depends on the Druid's skill. Due to its unique origin, the power of this shield can only be utilized by the most dedicated followers of Nature.

The blade is regular length for such a weapon, though slightly slimmer than what is normal for a long sword.  The hilt is a seperate piece and of regular steel.  The cross piece looks like two crescent moons each overlapping the other, similar to () overcrossing each other at the ends and the blade coming through the middle gap.  The hilt is also wrapped in a cross-hatched pattern of blue and green wire threads.

The blade was constructed some one-hundred-fifty years ago by a human ranger turned mage from the Archwood area, named Frasfer the Brown.  He and a few companions were keeping guard in the Archwood, when an influx of werewolves caused him to attempt the creation of a magical means to making their elimination easier.  One of his companions was a druid, and the mixing of druidic magic and wizard magic created a blade reknowned for a later owner.

That later owner was Nazger, a soldier of Sembia who found the sword fifty years ago.  He used it to find wererats that were murdering people in Highmoon, a city just northwest of the Archwood.  So Nazger exposed the wererats and killed most of them off.  However, while fighting in the sewers of the city he disappeared.  Nothing was ever again found of Nazger, except his sword.  It was later recognized in the market, but reported too late.  It was sold to a caravan heading to Ordulin.

As Nazgar had no immediate family the city guard did little investigation.  All that was turned up was that a street beggar found the blade in the sewers and thought to sell it for food in the market.  The begger claimed to know nothing else.

The powers of the blade may have become revealed to the caravan and thus kept, or may have remained unknown and sold as merely a silver sword.

The Sword of Nazger is an unintelligent magic blade that is normally +1 to hit/damage, but gives a +3 bonus to hit/damage versus werecreatures of all types.  It also gives the wielder a tingling sensation similar to when one's hand falls asleep when werecreatures are within 60' of the user, though it won't indicate who it is that is a werecreature, nor get more powerful if the werebeast gets closer.   The blade will also appear to have a set of glyphs along the blade if viewed under a full moon.

One of the victors, the sorcerer-mage Shandellon, felt a twinge of conscience when he saw the damaged village, and to redeem himself, he took the sole survivor with him and raised the young orc as his own son.

Under Shandellon's guidance, Chotog began to master magic despite his origins. However, Chotog had to put in much more effort than the people who learned from Shandellon, and he achieved less. The orc became jealous, and locked himself in his room for days, working without rest on a subject that would allow him to surpass the other students.

The fruit of his labors was a helmet, rather ugly, but with the remarkable property of greatly increasing the intelligence of the wearer. Chotog immediately put on his treasure. He soon discovered, however, that ignorance is the best gift for an envious orc whose existence is so pathetic. Shandellon found the charred remains of his adopted son, all in his helmet, now blackened, next to a short note: "Some ideas are best left unrealized."

<tr><th class="title">NWTHTD<br/>Returning throwing dagger +1</th><td class="description before"><pre>Being the weapon of choice for most fast and agile warriors, throwing daggers are light on everything and very easy to conceal.

While these weapons cannot do serious damage, the speed at which they can be thrown gives them a great advantage over heavier weapons.

The characteristics of this particular dagger have been magically improved - apparently at the behest of shadow thieves. However, it does not bear any identifying marks. The magical properties have increased its attack potential, and - even more valuable about it - it can return to the wielder's hand after being thrown, ensuring that he is always equipped for battle.

Unnoticed by most experts, these little sponges are able to absorb acid and deposit it in their bodies without harming themselves.

The sponge is then slipped onto the arrow head and is ready for use. By striking the opponent with the right amount of force, the coating is torn, the sponge is released, and the client is fobbed off with acid.
