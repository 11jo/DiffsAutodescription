Its blade shimmers in a slick, intoxicating tinge of green, likely literally as well as metaphorically. The sword's grip and hilt are lined by curved thorns which make it hard to see how this weapon could be effectively wielded in battle. Judging by the dried crusts around them, many have still tried, and you cannot deny feeling a tempting curiosity on your part.

Whatever its provenance, it has since traveled through many hands (albeit the majority not of the living persuasion). The common thread running through all these encounters was that their eventual end was rarely of a voluntary nature and nothing good ever came from them.
