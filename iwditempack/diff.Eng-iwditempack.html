  as not to expose herself as a priestess of Auril. When as much as a single 
  snowflake falls upon the robe, it transforms into a scintillating cloak of 
  white that allows the wielder to float above snow drifts and walk through 
  even raging rivers with ease. Most merchants will not wish to purchase this 
  item, or will do so at a very low price, as they see it as a sacred item of 
  Auril the Frost-Maiden and likely to attract her followers... and her 
  displeasure.

  Created during the ceremonies of the Coming Storm (the onset of winter) to 
  Auril, these robes are specially created to resist flames and allow the 
  wearer to resist any attempt to stop or hold them. Although the priestesses 
  of Auril are naturally resistant to cold and can move through snow and icy 
  rivers with ease, these cloaks amplify the protection of the goddess, 
  allowing the wearer additional cold resistance (which allows a wearer already 
  immune to cold to absorb its power) and even goes so far as to leach the heat 
  from fire attacks directed at the wearer. In addition, the robe may be 
  invoked to allow the wearer to pass over or through any obstacle designed to 
  hold them, whether Web spells, ghoul paralyzation, Hold Person spells and the

<tr><th class="title">xochancd<br/>Chain of Drakkas' Fury</th><td class="description before"><pre>Drakkas Ranul was an outcast Moon Elf with a huge chip on his shoulder.  At a
very young age, Drakkas was kidnapped by a Drow raiding party and brought up by
the Drow to be a pit fighter.  At first he fought his fellow kidnap victims in
the pits.  However, over time, his fellow abductees died from their wounds and
poor treatment, thus leaving Drakkas alone to eventually fight monsters of the
Drow's choosing.  Drakkas persevered, fueled by his ever-growing hatred for his
captors, the hopes of one day escaping and then taking revenge on his
kidnappers.

One day Drakkas got his wish - he was able to escape by stealing his jail cell
keys from his lazy night guard, and then stealthfully slipping out into the
unforgiving Underdark.  He managed to steal a couple of scimitars on his way
out, which he put to good use while circumventing the twisted corridors of the
Underdark.  When he emerged on the surface, he immediately sought out his Moon
Elf kin.

Unfortunately, when he found his kin, they ostracized him due to his horrendous
battle scars.  Embittered and outcast, he made it his mission in life to exact
the most painful revenge possible on his kidnappers.  Drakkas diligently 
trained in the dark magics, and continued his formidable weapons training as 
well.  When he got to the point where he felt he was ready, he began to sell 
his services as a mercenary to earn coin and buy better equipment.  One thing 
in particular he eventually wanted was lightweight chain mail that would not 
interfere with his spell casting.  Luck was with him the day he found a Dwarven 
armorsmith who could accommodate Drakkas' needs.  It was not long after until 
the armor was finished and Drakkas was ready for his mission of revenge.

Drakkas disappeared from the people who knew him and utilized his mercenary
services, and ventured into the depths of the Underdark, where he was never
heard from again.  However, his special armor did somehow make it out of the
Underdark.  No one knows how, but speculation has it that the return of 
Drakkas' chain mail to the surface world was a subtle message from the Drow.  
The message, of course, was left to the imagination of the interpreter.

one item from his astounding list of enchanted dungeoneering equipment is his
Everlasting Torch.  A magical lantern fashioned in the shape of an elaborate
wooden torch, the item burns with a bright orange flame that cannot be
extinguished - whether dunked in water, buried under several feet of rock, or
smashed over the head of a soggy marsh-troll, Belib's Everlasting Torch simply
will not be put out.

When Belib finally finished the last of his items, he crammed them all into a
giant pack - enchanted to hold far more than Belib could normally carry 
himself, of course - and heaved it onto his shoulders, prepared for the 
adventure of a lifetime.  As Belib crossed the threshold of his dwelling he 
tripped... and the tiny gnome was instantly crushed beneath his enormous 
backpack.  The bag burst open, its contents scattering across the Waterdeep 
street where Belib had lived and rapidly vanishing into the hands of various 
good-for-nothing passersby.

Belib's corpse was eventually taken to a temple and raised by a kind-hearted
priestess, but by then the last of Belib's enchanted items... and most of the
contents of his home... were long gone.  Grateful but understandably upset,

<tr><th class="title">xohfbtsb<br/>Binding Sash of the Black Raven</th><td class="description before"><pre>The Sash of the Black Raven is rumored to be a symbol of one of the disciples 
of the Black Raven monastery, a sanctuary located deep within the heart of the
Spine of the World Mountains.  According to legend, the Black Raven is a near
mythical figure in Uthgardt legends, a punishing spirit from the underworld who
emerged on the surface world many years ago to teach the barbarians humility 
and break their arrogance.  Described as a dark-skinned man with burning eyes 
and bloodied chains hanging from his wrists, the stories that circle the Black 
Raven frequently tell of his epic struggles against slavers and injustice 
throughout the North and the southern kingdoms.  Some historians speculate that 
the Black Raven may have been a drow or half-drow, but others claim that he was 
a minor or quasi-deity dedicated to ending slavery and oppression.

This black sash is made of fine silk, perhaps spider silk, and it is worn 
looped around the waist.  While worn, it helps the wearer focus in combat, 
freeing his mind of all distractions and channeling his inner energies to 
defeat his foes. When worn by any class other than a monk, it immediately 
unknots itself and falls to the ground.


STATISTICS:

Special:
  +2 Attack Bonus to all attacks
  Spellward:  Immunity to the spells Confusion, Feeblemind, Sleep, 
   Charm Person, and Cloak of Fear
