<tr><th class="title">CMBWQ02<br/>Long Bow of O'Locksley</th><td class="description before"><pre>The famed archer and outlaw O'Locksley constructed this bow with the aid of a sympathetic mage to aid in his quest to rid the country of the harsh and oppressive master that held the peasantry in an iron vice of fear. Not a small portion of his fame as an archer without peer is due to the powers of his wondrous bow. After his tragic death, O'Locksley's bow was passed on to his nephew; Jaen of Southerton Jaen used the bow for two decades to continue to fight injustice and evil in the country. He entrusted it to an elven friend before setting out on a secret mission from which he never returned. The elf gave the bow to his queen, and it has since been passed down among royalty of the elven court. Several times it has been lost, but it has always been recovered due to the diligence of the elve's searches. It was last used in a raid on the Goblin King's Lair. Both Treestalker and the bow were lost after the raid, and the elves are continually searching for both.

Thee bow is of exceptional quality, it is made of ancient yew that some say came from thee the great World Tree, Yaggissdril. The magic bow is of such that it never needs to be restrung or tightened, even after getting wet. The draw of the bow is feather light so extreme accuracy and speed is easily obtained.

An infamous highwayman in his day, Pandar of Scardale made quite a name for himself vexing the elves of Cormanthor forest. To their annoyance he continually used the wood to escape the law; and with the aid of this girdle, the elves' arrows as well.  Unfortunately for Pandar, pit-traps and starvation proved a slower, but effective, substitution. Combined with potion of fire giant strength you gain the strength of one.
