Most scholars call this treasure "Dweomer's Heart", though common mortals can see such item only in historical books as it had changed hands of many great mages, liches and demigods through blood, battle and intrigues.
Karsus's amulet is a great boon to any practitioner of the arcane arts except for wild mages. As it's strong connection with the Weave can turn them into madness or even instantly kill. 
Though this ill-fated relic bears a great power, it is also a great burden, as it weakens the wearer physically and morally.
