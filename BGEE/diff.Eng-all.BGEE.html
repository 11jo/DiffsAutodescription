"Oh, shocked from the strike of his powerful bow,
The slain game sought by Adaniss falls.
Long ago in the time of the Quiet Earth,
The hunt from the famed High Forest calls.

"The Duke of Everlund known for his boast 
Of the trophies held in his pride as dear. 
Intensely enraged at his rival hunter
Whose bounty by far surpassed his one year. 

"One morn tragedy befell the land
With the misconceived death of the Duke's prized hound.
Fallen at the base of a great elm tree 
A bow's shot death in its heart was found. 

"With skill so great targets in his eyes were at the mercy of his arrow's flight.
His hands sure and still,
Never missing a kill,
None could match the marksmanship of Adaniss Rhyte.

"The same eve Adaniss called on the Duke,
His solemn mistake he wished to repay.
But the noble's rage claimed ten pounds of flesh
And an archer's arm hit the ground that day.

"The evil lord demanded justice unjust
The most vile curse on his arm to be cast.
Vengeance he sought for the price he had paid
Rhyte vowed the hound's arrow not to be his last.

"In sorrow the town helped him forge an axe
Blessed to honor his most glorious day.
With the mark of Rhyte's arrow to guide its strike
And reputed to kill in the very same way.

"With skill so great targets in his eyes were at the mercy of his arrow's flight.
His hands sure and still,
Never missing a kill,
None could match the marksmanship of Adaniss Rhyte.

"Again called the forest with its precious game,
And a prize Adaniss with thrill did he seek. 
But none could be finer than the great clawed falcon 
Sought by all amidst the forest's Lost Peaks.

"Once more the rivalry of the Duke did stir,
For he thought of his skills with Rhyte's bow to be best.
And set his sights on the glorious bird 
To emerge as the holder of its sainted crest.

"The two climbed the peaks and searched days on end,
Each of their wills set as strong as the stone.
They found each other at a cliff by chance;
Both of their hatreds ran as deep as the bone.

"With skill so great targets in his eyes were at the mercy of his arrow's flight.
His hands sure and still,
Never missing a kill,
None could match the marksmanship of Adaniss Rhyte.

"The Duke drew the bow and pulled the string taut,
But first flew Adaniss's axe with its blow.
Cleaved, the lord stumbled to cliff's edge and off,
Defeated by Rhyte's last arrow...

– Immunity to stun

Armor Class: 3 (5 vs. piercing and missile)
Requires:
 6 Strength

Weight: 20</pre></td><td class="description after"><pre>Once worn by the dekanter goblin warlord Kruntur, this armor is of an unusually high quality considering the race of its owner—most non-goblin smiths won't bother making armor suitable for goblinoid physiques, while those few goblins who know how to use a forge are generally more focused on weaponry. Kruntur prized this armor to such a degree that, upon his death, he refused to leave it. To this day, more than a hundred years later, his spirit still permeates the armor, whispering threats to all who dare wear it and generally making a nuisance of himself. He cannot directly harm the wearer, however, and for a goblinoid, the chance to have such fine protection might well make up for the aggravation the armor brings with it.

Alimor borrowed a lightning bolt from the storm giant to craft this halberd for his companion, Haldus, who had often complained about how the party never found any magic halberds despite it being his chosen weapon. Haldus was so excited by the storm giant's gift that he wielded it immediately, striking a boulder that happened to be nearby, and was promptly struck dead by the captured lightning's power.

Originally devised for such dire circumstances only, he quickly grew fond of its potential to cut all sorts of quarrels short and before long came to rely upon it wholly.

Many stories circulated of those who had survived and escaped by whim of his Fickle Finger and thus known, it happened to fail him at rather a crucial moment before long.

In the presence of any shapeshifting creature, however, the blade becomes warm as its power stirs. Its namesake was the original owner of the weapon, and his tale, though mostly long forgotten, was wrought with treachery and deceit. Rumors persist that he paid a fearsome price for this blade, but with it he revealed the true identities of those that sought to betray him. Their names and crimes however, are long since lost to history.
